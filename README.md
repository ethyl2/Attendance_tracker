udacity-frontend-attendance
===========================

This is a Udacity project that is an exercise in taking "spaghetti code" and
turning it into more organized code.

This page takes attendance data and displays it in a table. It calculates and
displays the number of missed days. If the user checks or unchecks days in the
the table, the number of missed days is recalculated.

See js/app.js and scroll to the end to see the original code.

I took the code and organized it into 3 parts: the model, the controller, and the view.
